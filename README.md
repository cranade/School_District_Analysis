# School District Analysis

## Overview

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for ninth graders of Thomas High School ,a Charter School,  appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once I have replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like me to repeat the school district analysis that I did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

This report documents this work of my team and me.

## Findings

My team and I followed the advice of Maria and modified the code given by her to use Python, Panda and Numpy and completed the analysis. We removed the 9th grade results for Thomas High School. The following are the findings.
